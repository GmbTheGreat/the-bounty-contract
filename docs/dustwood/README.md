# Dustwood – Part 1

Dustwood is the **first playable part** of *The Bounty Contract*.

It introduces the world, tone, and mission of the game.  
The town is abandoned, silent, and dangerous — controlled by outlaws working under the **Crow Master**.

This document explains **what happens in Dustwood** and **how it was built**, in simple language.

## Story Overview

Dustwood was once a living town.  
Now it stands empty.

The player arrives by **train**, hired by a sheriff to hunt a dangerous outlaw known as **Crow Master**.  
The player does not know the town or its past — only the contract.

As the player explores Dustwood:
- Strange silence fills the streets  
- Wind and dust move through broken buildings  
- Enemies hide and watch from a distance  

Dustwood is not safe.

## Opening Cutscene

1. Camera starts at the **church bell**
2. Bell sound plays for a few seconds
3. Camera slowly moves down to the **church cross**
4. Camera pulls back toward the **train station**
5. A train arrives in Dustwood
6. Narration begins (storytelling tone)

This cutscene sets the mood: abandoned, quiet, and tense.

## Gameplay in Dustwood

- Player arrives from the train
- Free exploration of the town
- Small interactions (environment, NPCs)
- First gunfights with gang members
- Enemies use cover (crates, walls, buildings)
- Player can take cover to avoid bullets

This part is **short and focused**, designed for 5–10 minutes of gameplay.

---

## Enemies

- Low-poly outlaw characters
- Basic AI behavior:
  - Take cover
  - Step out to shoot
  - Return to cover
- All enemies are under **Crow Master**

Crow Master himself is **not fought here** — this part builds tension.

---

## Sound Design

- Church bell (opening)
- Wind ambience (desert, abandoned town)
- Light background music (slow, minimal)
- Gunshots and footsteps

Sound is kept simple to match performance limits.

---

## Assets & Optimization

- Low-poly models only
- Single materials where possible
- Merged meshes for buildings
- Simple collisions
- Optimized for **web performance (Zimension)**

---

## Tools Used

- Blender (model cleanup, materials, armature fixes)
- Mixamo (rigging and animations)
- Zimension (game logic, cutscenes, interactions)
- CapCut (sound layering and editing)
- GitHub (documentation)
